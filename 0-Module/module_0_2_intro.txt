Welcome back. This is the third lesson in the module covering the background as part of the course preparing you for the IBM Qiskit Certification Exam.

Welcome back. In the previous lesson we covered the fundamental quantum gates and applied them to single-qubit systems. We covered the Hadamard gate, the Pauli gates, and the rotation gates and how they apply to single qubits. Here we expand to multi-qubit systems.

In this module, we’ll set up the essentials for handling two or more qubits. We’ll define multi-qubit basis states via tensor products, explain how |q1 q0⟩ maps to vector indices, and note the 2^n growth of state dimension. We’ll practice placing single-qubit gates inside larger registers (e.g., I⊗X vs. X⊗I), use SWAP or re-ordering when positions matter, and cover measurement readouts. We’ll also discuss Qiskit’s little-endian convention—qubit 0 is the least significant bit—so you can predict bitstrings and index order correctly.

We'll also go through several examples with detailed explanations to allow you to be confident in predicting the resulting state when applying a series fo gates to multi-qubit systems.

Let's get started!
